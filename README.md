This is my first python app. A Human vs AI chess game. In this app you will play against a chess AI, you will play as the white pieces while the AI will play as the black pieces.

This app utilizes the stockfish chess-engine to determine the AI's best moves, while the board is being rendered using the pygame library.

In order to move, just click and drag any white piece on the board. There are no realtime rendering therefore there won't be any visual feedback however once you release you mouse, if the move you have chosen is valid, the game will play accordingly.
